Hello desertfox,

I use hostgator for personal hosting but am migrating away. 

I informed the hostgator support team last week that the entire support chat API and (I believe)Salesforce API is publically exposed by right clicking 
on the chat panel and viewing the source. 
I don't have social media and have no idea how to get in touch with anyone who works there that isn't on the other side of the planet. 
Sorry to bother you this way, but felt the need to get this in front of someone who made have a contact there. 

Thanks,
Jack
